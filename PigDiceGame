 The objective of this game is too get the highest points from rolling the dice without rolling 1
                             The game will start with Player1
                          The game will alternate between players
 The points will be added up between each rolls as long as the player does not roll the number 1
           When the number 1 is rolled, all the player previous score will be erased
       His/Her/Its score will be returned to the number before the player rolls the dice
                           Players can choose the number of rounds they want to play
        A Player's ability to know when to stop will be the biggests factor in this game
                                 Have Fun and Good luck
